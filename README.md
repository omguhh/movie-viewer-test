# movie-viewer-test

Create a simple movie viewer web app, where you can view a movie's overview, cast and cast details. 

You can view an example by searching in google (mobile view) for any movie; You can also refer to the included screenshots and the following gif for design and layout ideas:

You can use the open movie database api for this exercise to load a movie's data: https://www.omdbapi.com/ 

App features:
- ~~Dropdown menu for share and send feedback actions (not required to implement the share and send feedback actions)~~
- ~~Tabs for overview and cast content~~
- ~~An image slider for the movie images~~
- ~~Sticky tabs bar: it should always be at the top of the page as you scroll~~
- ~~Animations: active tab switching animation, cast list to cast details page loading animation~~
- ~~For cast details page, you can display static information (doesn't have to load the data from the omdb api)~~

Note: this isn't as perfect as I would've liked, the animations aren't exactly the smoothest things and there's some gotchas/bugs around, but theyre quite minor and have the overall functionality. This web app has 2 views, desktop/mobile. The mobile version behaves a bit more like the google gif, the desktop version is my own layout and doesn't have the cast overview section..but has a cast popup for more details about them.
